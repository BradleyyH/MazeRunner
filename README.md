# Maze Runner

An A* search algorithm finding the optimal solution through procedurally generated maps in python.
This will utilise libraries like Pygame and numpy.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the maze environment:
```bash
python mazeEnvironment.py
```

## Planned Features
- Procedural maze generation using recursive backtracking
- Interactive maze size adjustment
- A* pathfinding algorithm visualization
- Real-time maze solving visualization
